This is a simple "Map Generator".
It works by first creating a empty Map object with N number of "Blocks" all having a coordinate (x/y).
A block is another empty object which can be filled with a number of criteria, for example which type of Block is it? (Water, Mountains, roads etc...).

Using the MapSettings I made a randomizer which can make random maps which are still bound to specific criteria which someone can enter. Afterwards in the main "Program.cs" script I made a visual display in a Windows Console. Both to input the settings for a map, and the eventual display.

Towards the end I spent some time creating different "map" types, for example a map which instead of having a Square form would end up having a Cross as a form, or even a map made up of lines.
